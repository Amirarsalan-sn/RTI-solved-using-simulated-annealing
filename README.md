# RTI-solved-using-simulated-annealing
Solving Random 3-SAT(Boolean satisfiability problem) using simulated annealing.
This code provides a fast algorithm for evaluating a CNF and also provides two types of noise functions which you can see their empact on the result from the 
commits(add_noise_2 worked better). You can use this code to design your own simulated annealing algorithm.

# to install the pysat library:
```
pip install python-sat
